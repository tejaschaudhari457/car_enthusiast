1. Introduction to Automobiles
1.1 What is an Automobile?
An automobile is a self-propelled vehicle designed primarily for passenger or goods transportation.
Classification of Automobiles:
Category	Types
By Purpose	Passenger Cars, Commercial Vehicles, Off-road Vehicles, Racing Cars
By Fuel Type	Gasoline, Diesel, Electric (EV), Hybrid (HEV/PHEV), Hydrogen (FCEV)
By Body Style	Sedan, SUV, Coupe, Hatchback, Convertible, Wagon, Pickup Truck, Van
1.2 History & Evolution of Cars
•	Early Era (1800s): Steam-powered vehicles (Cugnot Steam Trolley).
•	1886: Karl Benz patents the first gasoline-powered car.
•	1908: Ford Model T introduces mass production (assembly line).
•	Modern Era: Turbocharging, Hybrids (Toyota Prius, 1997), EVs (Tesla), Autonomous Driving.

2. Car Anatomy: Major Components & Systems
2.1 Chassis & Frame
Definition: The structural backbone of a vehicle.
Types of Chassis:
1.	Ladder Frame (Used in trucks & SUVs)
2.	Monocoque (Unibody) (Most modern cars – lightweight, better crash safety)
3.	Space Frame (High-performance cars – aluminum/carbon fiber)
2.2 Engine (Powerplant)
Types of Engines:
A. By Fuel Type:
•	Gasoline (Petrol) Engines (Spark ignition, higher RPM)
•	Diesel Engines (Compression ignition, more torque, better fuel efficiency)
•	Electric Motors (Instant torque, battery-powered)
•	Hybrid Engines (Combination of ICE + Electric)
•	Hydrogen Engines (Fuel Cell or Combustion)
B. By Cylinder Arrangement:
Type	Examples	Characteristics
Inline (I)	I4, I6 (BMW)	Simple, balanced, compact
V-Type	V6, V8 (Mustang GT)	Compact width, high power
Flat/Boxer	H4 (Subaru WRX)	Low center of gravity
Rotary	Mazda RX-7/8	High RPM, compact, less efficient
C. By Aspiration:
•	Naturally Aspirated (NA) – Relies on atmospheric pressure.
•	Forced Induction:
o	Turbocharged (Uses exhaust gases to compress air)
o	Supercharged (Belt-driven compressor)
Key Engine Components:
1.	Cylinder Block – Houses pistons & crankshaft.
2.	Pistons – Move up/down to compress air-fuel mix.
3.	Crankshaft – Converts linear motion to rotational.
4.	Camshaft – Controls valve timing.
5.	Turbocharger – Increases air intake density.
2.3 Transmission Systems
Types of Transmissions:
Type	How It Works	Pros & Cons
Manual (MT)	Driver-operated clutch & gear shift	More control, engaging, but slower shifts
Automatic (AT)	Torque converter + planetary gears	Smooth, but less efficient
CVT	Belt & pulley system (no fixed gears)	Fuel-efficient, but lacks sportiness
DCT	Dual-clutch for ultra-fast shifts	Used in performance cars (Porsche PDK)
2.4 Drivetrain Layouts
Type	Description	Examples
FWD	Front wheels powered	Honda Civic
RWD	Rear wheels powered	BMW 3 Series
AWD	All wheels powered (full-time)	Subaru Impreza
4WD	Selectable 4x4 mode	Jeep Wrangler
2.5 Suspension System
Types of Suspension:
1.	Independent Suspension (Each wheel moves independently)
o	MacPherson Strut (Common in economy cars)
o	Double Wishbone (Performance cars – better handling)
o	Multi-Link (Balanced comfort & performance)
2.	Non-Independent Suspension
o	Solid Axle (Trucks, off-roaders – durable but less refined)
o	Torsion Beam (Budget cars – simple, compact)
2.6 Braking System
Types of Brakes:
•	Disc Brakes (Better cooling, performance – drilled/slotted variants)
•	Drum Brakes (Older/rear wheels in budget cars)
•	ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) – Prevents wheel lockup.
•	Regenerative Braking (EVs) – Recovers energy during deceleration.
2.7 Steering System
•	Rack & Pinion (Most common – precise, direct feel)
•	Recirculating Ball (Older trucks – less precise but durable)
•	Electric Power Steering (EPS) (Modern cars – fuel-efficient)
2.8 Electrical & Electronics
•	Battery (12V Lead-Acid / Lithium) – Starts the engine & powers electronics.
•	Alternator – Charges battery while driving.
•	ECU (Engine Control Unit) – Manages fuel injection, ignition timing.
•	Sensors:
o	O2 Sensor (Monitors exhaust gases)
o	MAF Sensor (Measures air intake)
o	Knock Sensor (Detects engine knocking)

3. Performance & Dynamics
3.1 Horsepower vs. Torque
•	Horsepower (HP) = Power (how fast work is done)
•	Torque (Nm/lb-ft) = Rotational force (pulling power)
3.2 Aerodynamics
•	Drag Coefficient (Cd) – Lower = more efficient (Tesla Model S: 0.24 Cd)
•	Downforce – Keeps car planted at high speeds (spoilers, diffusers).
3.3 Handling & Grip
•	Tire Types:
o	Summer Tires (Best grip in warm conditions)
o	Winter Tires (Softer rubber for snow/ice)
o	All-Season Tires (Compromise between both)
•	Wheel Alignment:
o	Camber (Tilt of wheels – negative camber improves cornering)
o	Toe (Direction wheels point – toe-in/out affects stability)
3.4 Tuning & Modifications
•	Engine Tuning: ECU Remap, Turbo Upgrade, Cold Air Intake.
•	Suspension Mods: Lowering Springs, Coilovers, Sway Bars.
•	Exhaust Upgrades: Cat-Back, Headers, Muffler Delete.
